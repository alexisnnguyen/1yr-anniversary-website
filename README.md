# 1-Year Anniversary Website

üéâ Happy 1-Year Anniversary, Charles! üéâ

## Overview

This repository contains the code for a special website dedicated to celebrating our wonderful one-year journey together. The website is a labor of love, and I hope you enjoy exploring it as much as I enjoyed creating it.

## Features

- **Personalized Design**: The website is designed with your preferences and our memories in mind. I've incorporated colors, themes, and elements that hold special significance for us.
- **Timeline of Us**: Navigate through a visual timeline highlighting memorable moments from the past year. Each event is a reminder of our shared laughter, joy, and growth.
- **Photo Gallery**: A collection of our favorite pictures together. Hover over each image for a surprise caption or memory attached to it.
- **Interactive Love Notes**: Leave and read love notes in a special section of the website. Share your thoughts, memories, or even just a sweet message.
